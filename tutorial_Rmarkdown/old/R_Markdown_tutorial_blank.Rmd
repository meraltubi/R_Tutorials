# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

2 ## gives the largest title  
1 # gives a smaller title  
and no # provides supporting text  
2 trailing spaces provides a new line of text

# Knit a document
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 


# Import libraries
```{r libraries, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

## Chunk options 
Chunk Options
Chunk output can be customized with knitr options, arguments set in the {} of a chunk header. Above, we use five arguments:

include = FALSE prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. R Markdown still runs the code in the chunk, and the results can be used by other chunks.
echo = FALSE prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures.
message = FALSE prevents messages that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file.
warning = FALSE prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished.
fig.cap = "..." adds a caption to graphical results.


# Import files

## Import CSV files
 
You can import your data files like this:

```{r import}
demogs <-read.csv("/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/R_Scripts/Braskie_R_Workshop/tutorial_01/orig_files/demogs_fordf1df2.csv")
df1 <-read.csv("/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/R_Scripts/Braskie_R_Workshop/tutorial_01/orig_files/df1_corticalthickness.csv")
df2 <-read.csv("/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/R_Scripts/Braskie_R_Workshop/tutorial_01/orig_files/df2_corticalthickness.csv")

```


#View your data
```{r view}
summary(demogs)

ls() # list objects in the working environment
names(demogs) # list the variables in mydata
str(demogs) # list the structure of mydata
dim(demogs) # dimensions of an object
class(demogs) # class of an object (numeric, matrix, data frame, etc)

demogs # print mydata
head(demogs) #the head of the entire dataframe
head(demogs, n=15) #the head of the entire dataframe

head(demogs$SubjID)# the head of jsut the column
tail(demogs$Sex..IDA.) # the tail of just the column 
demogs$Scan.date #pull just a column

demogs$SubjID[10] #the 10th subject
demogs$SubjID[10:15] #the 10-15th subjects
demogs$SubjID[c(10:15,20)]
demogs[demogs$SubjID==9024,]
demogs[1:5,]
demogs[, 1:2]

```


#Merge Plots
```{r merge, echo=FALSE}


```

#Manipulate Data
```{r manipulate, echo=FALSE}

#demogs$age.z <-scale()

#old <-subset(demogs, age< )


```

# Including Plots
You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r plot}
boxplot(demogs$Age..IDA.)
```


```{r hist, echo=FALSE}
hist(demogs$Age..IDA.)
```


#Linear Regression
```{r regression, echo=FALSE}
#model1 <- lm(outcome~predictor, )
#summary()
```


#Linear Regression Interactions
```{r interact, echo=FALSE}
#model2 <- lm(outcome~predictor*modifier, )
#summary(model2)
```
